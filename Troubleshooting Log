Sentiment Analysis Project: Complete Journey & Troubleshooting Log
ðŸ“‹ PROJECT OVERVIEW
Goal: Create a sentiment analysis toolkit for business understanding using Python, analyze survey data, and publish to GitHub
________________________________________
ðŸš€ STEP-BY-STEP JOURNEY
1. INITIAL SETUP & TUTORIAL REQUEST
â€¢	Started with: Request to learn sentiment analysis in Python from step 1
â€¢	Provided: Complete tutorial artifact with TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis
â€¢	Included: Sample survey data analysis, visualizations, and business insights

2. GITHUB REPOSITORY CREATION
â€¢	User Action: Created repository Sentiment-Analysis_BU on GitHub
â€¢	Issue: Repository was empty, needed to add code files
â€¢	Solution: Provided comprehensive README, sentiment analyzer class, and file structure

3. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE SETUP
â€¢	Files Created: 
o	README.md (comprehensive documentation)
o	sentiment_analyzer.py (main Python class)
o	tutorial.py (complete tutorial code)
o	requirements.txt (dependencies)
o	.gitignore (Python template)
o	LICENSE (MIT license)
4. LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SETUP

4A. Repository Cloning
â€¢	Command Used: git clone https://github.com/SyrettaMeeks/Sentiment-Analysis_BU.git
â€¢	Location: Documents\Sentiment-Analysis_BU
â€¢	Result: âœ… Successfully cloned repository

4B. Running the Tutorial
â€¢	Command: python tutorial.py
â€¢	First Run Results: 
o	âœ… Successfully analyzed survey data
o	âœ… Generated sentiment scores: 50% Positive, 43.8% Neutral, 6.2% Negative
o	âœ… Created pricing sentiment analysis
o	âœ… Showed business insights

5. VISUALIZATION ISSUES & TROUBLESHOOTING

5A. Problem: Script Hanging at Step 9
â€¢	Issue: Tutorial got stuck at STEP 9: CREATING VISUALIZATIONS
â€¢	Cause: matplotlib trying to display charts in command prompt environment
â€¢	Symptoms: 
o	Cursor flashing, couldn't type in CMD
o	Script appeared frozen
â€¢	Solutions Applied: 
o	Ctrl + C to force stop the script
o	Created tutorial_no_viz.py (version without problematic visualizations)
o	Continued with analysis despite visualization hang-up

5B. Command Recognition Errors
â€¢	Errors Encountered: 
â€¢	'dirv1' is not recognized as an internal or external command'19' is not recognized as an internal or external command  'pwd' is not recognized as an internal or external command'#' is not recognized as an internal or external command
â€¢	Cause: Mixing Linux/Mac commands with Windows CMD, using comment symbols as commands
â€¢	Solution: Used correct Windows commands (dir, cd, proper Git commands)

6. GIT WORKFLOW & VERSION CONTROL
6A. Initial Push Rejection
â€¢	Error: 
â€¢	! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)error: failed to push some refs to 'repository'hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally
â€¢	Cause: Remote repository had changes (made via GitHub web interface) not present locally
â€¢	Solution: 
â€¢	git pull origin maingit push origin main
â€¢	Result: âœ… Successfully synchronized and pushed

6B. Successful Git Operations
â€¢	Commands Used: 
â€¢	git add .git commit -m Complete sentiment analysis toolkit with working tutorial and resultsgit push origin main
â€¢	Results: âœ… All files successfully uploaded to GitHub
7. RESULTS & ANALYSIS GENERATED

7A. Sentiment Analysis Results
â€¢	Overall Sentiment Distribution: 
o	50% Positive sentiment
o	43.8% Neutral sentiment
o	6.2% Negative sentiment
â€¢	Average Rating: 9.2/10
â€¢	Sentiment-Rating Correlation: Strong positive correlation

7B. Pricing Sentiment Analysis
â€¢	Key Findings: 
o	Most pricing responses: Neutral (0.0000 polarity)
o	2 Positive responses about pricing
o	0 Negative pricing responses
o	Business Insight: Price point is well-received

7C. Business Recommendations Generated:
â€¢	Leverage positive sentiment for marketing
â€¢	Current pricing strategy is working
â€¢	Focus on converting neutral customers to positive

8. VS CODE INTEGRATION

8A. Directory Structure Creation
â€¢	Created Path: Documents\Projects\Sentiment-Analysis_BU
â€¢	Commands Used: 
â€¢	cd Documentsmkdir Projectscd Projectsgit clone https://github.com/SyrettaMeeks/Sentiment-Analysis_BU.gitcode Sentiment-Analysis_BU

8B. VS Code Setup Success
â€¢	Result: âœ… Project opened in VS Code with complete file structure
â€¢	Files Visible: 
o	examples/ folder
o	plots/ folder
o	LICENSE
o	README.md
o	requirements.txt
o	sentiment_analyzer.py
o	tutorial_no_viz.py
o	tutorial.py

9. JUPYTER NOTEBOOK EXPLORATION

9A. File Path Error in Jupyter
â€¢	Error: 
â€¢	SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape
â€¢	Cause: Windows backslashes in file path interpreted as Unicode escape sequences
â€¢	Path Used: C:\Users\llwil\OneDrive\Desktop\mom\Product Innovation\Unit 4\AD741 - Product Survey (Responses) - Form Responses 1.csv
â€¢	Solutions Provided: 
o	Raw string: rC:\Users\llwil\OneDrive\...
o	Forward slashes: C:/Users/llwil/OneDrive/...
o	Double backslashes: C:\\Users\\llwil\\OneDrive\\...
o	pathlib approach: Path(C:/Users/...)
