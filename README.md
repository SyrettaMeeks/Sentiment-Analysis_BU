# Sentiment Analysis for Business Understanding (BU)

A comprehensive Python toolkit for performing sentiment analysis on survey data and customer feedback to drive business insights.

## 🎯 Project Background

This project was developed as part of my Master's program in Applied Business Analytics at Boston University, focusing on practical applications of sentiment analysis for business decision-making. The project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be used to understand customer feedback, validate product-market fit, and inform pricing strategies through real survey data analysis.

## 📊 Features

- **Multiple Sentiment Analysis Methods**: TextBlob and VADER implementations with comparative analysis
- **Business Correlation Analysis**: Connect sentiment with ratings and pricing willingness
- **Comprehensive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for data presentation and trend analysis
- **Export Capabilities**: Save results to CSV for further analysis and reporting
- **Tutorial-Based Learning**: Complete step-by-step implementation from data to insights

## 🚀 Live Demo

Check out the complete tutorial in action: [sentiment_tutorial.py](sentiment_tutorial.py)

Run the full analysis:
```bash
python sentiment_tutorial.py
```

### Quick Start

```python
from textblob import TextBlob
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Analyze customer feedback
text = "This product is innovative and ingenious!"
blob = TextBlob(text)
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

print(f"TextBlob Sentiment: {blob.sentiment.polarity}")  # 0.65 (positive)
print(f"VADER Compound: {analyzer.polarity_scores(text)['compound']}")  # 0.69 (positive)
```

## 💼 Key Business Insights

From our actual survey analysis of 16 customer responses:

### Customer Satisfaction Metrics
- **Positive Sentiment**: 87.5% of responses (14/16 responses)
- **Average Rating**: 9.2/10 (exceptional customer satisfaction)
- **Sentiment-Rating Correlation**: Strong positive correlation (r=0.68)
- **Method Agreement**: 93.8% agreement between TextBlob and VADER

### Pricing Strategy Validation
- **Willingness to Pay**: Positive sentiment strongly correlates with higher price acceptance
- **Price Range Acceptance**: $25-$450/month based on sentiment intensity
- **Value Perception**: Words like "innovative," "ingenious," and "convenient" indicate premium pricing opportunity

### Product Market Fit Indicators
- **Emotional Language**: Strong positive descriptors ("shocked," "enthusiastic," "love this")
- **Utility Focus**: High frequency of practical benefit mentions
- **Retention Signals**: Multiple responses indicating long-term value perception

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Sentiment Analysis Methods Comparison

**TextBlob**
- **Best for**: Clean, formal survey responses
- **Outputs**: Polarity (-1 to 1) and Subjectivity (0 to 1)
- **Our Results**: Average polarity of 0.42 (strong positive)

**VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**
- **Best for**: Informal language, intensifiers, emotional expressions
- **Outputs**: Compound score and individual pos/neg/neu scores
- **Our Results**: Average compound score of 0.51 (strong positive)

### Key Analytics Features

- **Temporal Analysis**: Sentiment tracking over survey collection period
- **Correlation Matrix**: Multi-variable relationship analysis
- **Pricing Sentiment**: Separate analysis of willingness-to-pay responses
- **Visualization Suite**: 4-panel dashboard with distribution, correlation, and trend analysis

## 📈 Business Applications

### Real-World Use Cases Demonstrated

**Product Validation**
- Analyze customer feedback to validate market fit
- Identify feature priorities through sentiment intensity
- Measure emotional response to product positioning

**Pricing Strategy**
- Correlate sentiment with price sensitivity
- Identify premium pricing opportunities
- Validate price point acceptance

**Customer Experience Optimization**
- Track satisfaction trends over time
- Identify pain points through negative sentiment analysis
- Prioritize improvement areas based on emotional impact
